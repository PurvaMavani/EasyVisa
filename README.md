# 🌍 EasyVisa - Visa Approval Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
EasyVisa is a **Supervised Learning Classification** project designed to predict visa application outcomes based on applicant details. With the increasing volume of visa applications worldwide, this project leverages machine learning to improve the efficiency of visa approval processes. The model identifies key factors influencing approvals and denials, enabling authorities to optimize decision-making and applicants to better understand approval chances.

## 🔍 Features
- **🧹 Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
- **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding patterns in visa approvals and denials.
- **🤖 Model Training**: Implementing Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost), and Stacking Classifiers.
- **📈 Performance Evaluation**: Assessing models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🚀 Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data preprocessing, EDA, and model-building steps.
- Modify hyperparameters and experiment with different classification algorithms.
- Analyze visa approval trends and model performance metrics.

## 📊 Sample Output
Example of model evaluation results:
```
Accuracy: 89%
Precision: 85%
Recall: 88%
F1-score: 86%
```
